Optimizing and comparing the design of a cathode catalyst layer by providing electron continuous paths for improving the performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells
Abstract:
Herein, the performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is improved by modifying cathode catalyst layers (CCLs) through the direct addition of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), vapor-grown carbon fibers (VGCFs), and carbon fibers (CFs). The optimal weight percentage (wt) of these three carbon materials is approximately 6 wt% after measuring the pristine (0 wt%), 1 wt%, 3 wt%, and 6 wt% contents of theirs. Among the additives, the addition of CFs results in the highest improvement in performance. When the temperature is maintained at 80 Â°C, the anode side and cathode side have a relative humidity (RH) of 100%, the stoichiometry of the reactant is 1.5 and 2.0, and in the absence of backpressure, the highest power density reaches 450 mWcm-2, which increases by 96% than that of the pristine. The MWCNTs and VGCFs increase the power density of PEMFCs by 73% and 54%, respectively.
