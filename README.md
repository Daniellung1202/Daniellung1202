- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chih-Jui, Lung, but you can call me Daniel. Currently, I'm pursuing masterâ€™s degree in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in semiconductor process technology. 
- âš¡ About me:

I am deeply passionate about the semiconductor industry. My motivation stems from completing the "Advanced technologies for CMOS semiconductor materials and memory integration Certificate" at the Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institution, where I enhanced my understanding of advanced semiconductor materials.

Building on this motivation, I gained valuable industry experience as an R&D Engineer at Nan Ya Printed Circuit Board Corp., specializing in data analysis and problem-solving with tools like JMP.

I then pursued coursework in Micro/Nano Device Fabrication and Characterization, gaining hands-on experience in the cleanroom of the Lurie Nanofabrication Facility, where I fabricated MOS devices on silicon wafers.

I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set and passion for innovation in a dynamic team within the semiconductor industry, contributing to cutting-edge projects.

Thank you for considering my profile. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your organization's success.

- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am a research assistant, part of Prof. Stephen Forrest's Optoelectronics Component Materials (OCM) group, where I'm immersed in learning and researching semiconductor device fabrication and characterization. My focus lies in integrating thermophotovoltaic devices on silicon substrates to build modules for energy conversion. This involves leveraging semiconductor manufacturing techniques to fabricate and characterize these devices, aiming to optimize their performance and efficiency.
